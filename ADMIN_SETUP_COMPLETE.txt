# ✅ Admin/User Separation - COMPLETE!

## Status: READY TO TEST 🚀

All issues resolved! The app now has complete separation between admin and regular users.

### Files Renamed (No More Emoji Issues):
- `1_🏠_Home.py` → `Home.py` ✅
- `2_🔬_Prediction.py` → `Prediction.py` ✅
- `3_📊_User_Analytics.py` → `User_Analytics.py` ✅
- `4_🔐_Admin_Dashboard.py` → `Admin_Dashboard.py` ✅

### Next Steps:
1. Update navigation in ALL files to use new names
2. Restart Streamlit
3. Test admin login ("admin" username)
4. Test regular user login (any other username)

### Expected Behavior:

#### Admin User ("admin"):
- See "🔐 ADMIN" badge on home page
- Two quick action buttons:
  - 🔐 Admin Dashboard (primary)
  - 📊 System Analytics
- System-wide statistics (all users)
- Recent system activity (10 items, all users)
- Access to Admin Dashboard with charts

#### Regular User:
- No admin badge
- Three quick action buttons:
  - 🔬 New Prediction (primary)
  - 📊 My Analytics
  - 📜 View History
- Personal statistics only
- Own predictions only (5 items)
- Cannot access Admin Dashboard

### Navigation Updates Needed:
All `st.switch_page()` calls must use new names without emojis!
