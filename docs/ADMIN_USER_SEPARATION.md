## How to Use

### Creating Admin Users

**Method 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
# In .env file
ADMIN_USERS=admin,john_admin,sarah_admin
```

**Method 2: Settings File**
```python
# In src/config/settings.py
admin_users: list[str] = Field(default=["admin", "your_username"])
```

### Admin Login Flow
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8501
2. Register/Login with admin username (e.g., "admin")
3. Home page automatically recognizes admin status
4. Shows "🔐 ADMIN" badge
5. Displays system-wide statistics
6. Click "Admin Dashboard" for full analytics

### Regular User Login Flow
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8501
2. Register/Login with any non-admin username
3. Home page shows personal dashboard
4. Displays personal statistics only
5. Primary focus on making predictions
6. Can view personal analytics

## Testing Checklist

### Admin User Testing:
- [ ] Login as "admin"
- [ ] Verify "🔐 ADMIN" badge appears on home page
- [ ] Check system-wide statistics display (Total Users, Total Predictions, etc.)
- [ ] Click "Admin Dashboard" button
- [ ] Verify admin dashboard loads successfully
- [ ] Check all charts display (Predictions Over Time, Class Distribution, etc.)
- [ ] Verify system-wide recent activity shows all users
- [ ] Try accessing prediction page (should work, optional feature)
- [ ] Logout and verify return to login page

### Regular User Testing:
- [ ] Login as any non-admin user (e.g., "testuser")
- [ ] Verify NO admin badge appears
- [ ] Check personal statistics display
- [ ] Verify "Admin Dashboard" button is NOT visible
- [ ] Click "New Prediction" - should navigate to prediction page
- [ ] Upload image and test prediction
- [ ] Click "My Analytics" - should show personal analytics only
- [ ] Verify recent predictions show only own predictions
- [ ] Try manually navigating to `/4_🔐_Admin_Dashboard` - should get access denied

### Access Control Testing:
- [ ] Login as regular user
- [ ] Try to access admin dashboard via URL
- [ ] Should see: "❌ Access Denied: Admin privileges required"
- [ ] Should have "Back to Home" button
- [ ] Verify session state preserved after denial

## Key Code Snippets

### Admin Check Pattern
```python
# In any page
is_admin = st.session_state.username in settings.admin_users

if is_admin:
    # Admin-specific code
    st.markdown("You are an admin!")
else:
    # Regular user code
    st.markdown("You are a regular user")
```

### Access Control Pattern
```python
# In admin-only pages
if not is_admin:
    st.error("❌ Access Denied: Admin privileges required")
    if st.button("🏠 Back to Home"):
        st.switch_page("pages/1_🏠_Home.py")
    st.stop()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Admin Dashboard not accessible
**Solution:** 
1. Check if username is in `settings.admin_users`
2. Verify `.env` file has `ADMIN_USERS` set correctly
3. Restart Streamlit app after changing settings

### Issue: Regular user sees admin features
**Solution:**
1. Check `is_admin` logic in pages
2. Verify `settings.admin_users` list
3. Clear browser cache and rerun

### Issue: Navigation errors
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all page files exist in `pages/` directory
2. Check file naming: `4_🔐_Admin_Dashboard.py` not `5_...`
3. Verify `st.switch_page()` uses correct relative paths
